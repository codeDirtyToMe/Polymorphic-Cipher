# Polymorphic-Cipher
An attempt at making a polymorphic cipher. The polymorphism will be based off of the number of iterations it takes the decimal value of the binary representation of the key to reach 1 when run through the Collatz function. Well, at least as a start to ordering the substitution and transposition ciphers.
